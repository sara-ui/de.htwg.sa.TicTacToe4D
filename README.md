# TicTacToe-3D-4-4-4
=========================

TicTacToe 3D 4 * 4 * 4

The idea behind this game is to place a sequence of your marker, either X or O, without being blocked by your opponent. A sequence may exist in form of a column, row or diagonal.

If there are no available unblocked sequences, the game ends in a draw.
